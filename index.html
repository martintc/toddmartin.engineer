			<h1>About the site and me</h1>
			
			<p>I am currently a software engineering student at Arizona State University (ASU) in my sophmore year. I also work full time, wife, and two kids that I take care of. So life is very busy.</p>
			<p>I created this site to serve as a portfolio, document my learning and to write about what I am interested in. Or, sometimes I write articles based off of common questions I get. As an example, in helping someone with pointers in C, I wrote 3 articles explaining how pointers and memory work, some interesting operations on pointers with math, and working with pointers with functions.</p>
			<p>My goal is not to run a super successful blog, it is to put information out there that someone may stumble upon and find interesting. Perhaps your professor or teacher explained a concept and it doesn't click. Perhaps, I offer an explanation or approach something at an angle that works for you, that is great! After all, the internet is a vast resource to use where a student can be connected with many different teachers of many types and knowledge levels. I am by no means an expert, but I will share my knowledge with the world freely.</p>
			<h2>Why my current blog set-up</h2>
			<p>I am sure my site looks like a blast from the 90s or early 2000s. It is 99% HTML and CSS creating static pages. I choose this instead of keeping a wordpress because I feel as a software engineering student, I should probably create my own solutions rather than rely on another's. I am by no means a professional web developer, honestly, web development isn't of huge interest to me. However, this site my motivate me to learn more and create my own content management system. Also, I wanted to get away from some of the newer technologies on the web. I am a die-hard FOSS advocate and user. I do not like how much of the web is being taken over by proprietary javascript. If it is something I don't like, why would I use it on my site? I also went with static pages without any fancy features or java script because the pages should be fairly fast to load. There is no complicated code that your browser must compile.</p>
